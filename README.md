# third-maximum-number

Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

Explanation:<br>
The first distinct maximum is 3.<br>
The second distinct maximum is 2.<br>
The third distinct maximum is 1.<br>

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]<br>
Output: 2<br>

Explanation:<br>
The first distinct maximum is 2.<br>
The second distinct maximum is 1.<br>
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.<br>

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation:<br>
The first distinct maximum is 3.<br>
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).<br>
The third distinct maximum is 1.
